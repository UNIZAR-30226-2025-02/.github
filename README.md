# CheckMateX

Welcome to our GitHub organization. We are a group of eight software engineering students collaborating on a chess game project as part of our Software Project course. Our aim is to create an intuitive chess platform that meets the needs of players and enthusiasts, following the requirements set by our client, Javier Lacasta.

This project is an opportunity for us to apply modern software development practices, work with cutting-edge technologies, and collaborate effectively as a team. We are using GitHub to manage our code, coordinate tasks, and track progress throughout the development cycle.

Within this GitHub organization, you will find: Code repositories for different components of our project: frontend web, frontend mobile and backend. As well as an issue tracker to monitor progress and address challenges.

We encourage you to explore our work and share your thoughts! If you're interested in contributing, collaborating, or providing feedback, feel free to reach out.
